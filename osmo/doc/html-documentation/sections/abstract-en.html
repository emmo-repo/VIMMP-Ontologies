<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Ontology for Simulation, Modelling, and Optimization (OSMO) is a semantic asset that can be employed to formally represent simulation workflows in materials modelling. It is based on RoMM and MODA, and was developed within the Horizon 2020 project Virtual Materials Marketplace (VIMMP) on the basis of consultations with representatives of the projects EMMC-CSA, MarketPlace, SmartNanoTox, and TaLPas.</span>
